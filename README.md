Develop an Angular application "User Manager" that basically (as the name implies) used to manage users.
The application should contain and consider the following:
1- Top Nav-bar with the following items: Home, Users and About.
2- Each item will navigate to a separate component (Angular component).
3- Home should have welcome text and two quick action items:
     a. Search text box to quickly find a user.
     b. Big "Add new user" button. See image:

4- Users component should have a data table with the following columns:
     Id, Name, Email, Role, Status, Creation Date and Action. See Image:

5- In Name column display the name of the user and the image/avatar to the left (as in above image).
6- There should be at least one component that has form to add/edit user's info (including upload user image).
7- All form(s) fields should be validated properly.
8- In About component put a few lines about yourself and how you implement this project.
9- Data should be stored and retrieved from Firebase.
10- Role dropdown (it should be a dropdown), use the following items:
     User, Administrator
11- Status dropdown, use:
     Active, Locked, Disabled
